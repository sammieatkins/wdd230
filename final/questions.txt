TO TURN IN:
* Reception Services page (Idea: have a link to a catering company and flower/decor company that the hotel partners with. setup: hotel employees help? maybe an employee is a wedding planner?)
* Temple Like Button
* Double check media queries on all pages

OTHER:
* missionary page: checkboxes customized
* thank you: modal (?), if not modal then something to separate logos?
* home page: flashing white on transition
* temple: edit data on STL temple info
